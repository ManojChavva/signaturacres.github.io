## Welcome to Signature Acres!

Hi there! I'm Manoj Chavva,  and I  developed this website for Signature Acres. 

## About the Project

 The foundation of this website is based on a free Bootstrap template, but I've customized it significantly to meet the specific needs of Signature Acres. While it started as a template, the modifications made are substantial, and the result is a unique and professional website.

## Hosting Information

Currently, this website is hosted on GitHub for transparency and easy access. You can check it out at the following link: signatureacres.in
[GitHub Repository](your-github-repo-url)

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Bootstrap Framework (Thanks to the awesome creators!)
- GitHub Pages for hosting

## Note

While the base template was freely licensed, I've transformed it into something entirely unique, and it now includes proprietary content for Signature Acres. Any use of the website template should respect this customization and not reflect any information related to Signature Acres without permission. Please refer the license for further https://github.com/ManojChavva/signaturacres.github.io?tab=License-1-ov-file

Feel free to explore the repository, and I'm always open to feedback and improvements. 

Thanks for stopping by!
